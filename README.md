# Machine-Learning-Titanic-Project


My goal was to predict who died or survived in the Titanic disaster using ADABOOST, GRADIENTBOOST, XGBOOST machine learning models. After trying models, I evaluated them using different metrics including F1 score, accuracy, ROC AUC, and precision-recall curve. Based on the evaluation results, I have chosen the XGBoost model as the best model for my prediction task. It achieved the highest F1 score of 0.769, as well as high accuracy and ROC AUC scores of 0.816 and 0.803, respectively. The precision-recall curve values were also strong, with a precision of 0.903. Overall, the XGBoost model provides the most accurate and reliable predictions of who perished in the Titanic disaster.
